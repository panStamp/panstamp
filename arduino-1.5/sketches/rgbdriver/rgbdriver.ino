 * Device:
 * RGB LED driver
 *
 * Description:
 * This device controls a RGB LED or a RGB LED strip using three PWM
 * outputs. RGB levels can be controlled via the RGBlevel register
 * (see Device Definition File for details). At the same time, this device
 * listens for the first Chronos watch appearing in the network and
 * synchronizes the RGB levels with the Chronos XYZ acceleration samples.
 *
 * Associated Device Definition File: rgbdriver.xml
